        Jaipur formerly Jeypore, is the capital and largest city of the Indian state of Rajasthan. As of 2011, the
        city had a population of 3.1 million, making it the tenth most populous city in the country. Jaipur is also
        known as the Pink City, due to the dominant colour scheme of its buildings. It is also known as the Paris of
        India, and C. V. Raman called it the Island of Glory. It is located 268 km (167 miles) from the national
        capital New Delhi. Jaipur was founded in 1727 by the Kachhwaha Rajput ruler Jai Singh II,[11][12] the ruler
        of Amer, after whom  <img src="images/Hawa mahal.jpg" style="float: right;"> the city is named. It was one of the earliest planned cities of modern India, designed
        by Vidyadhar Bhattacharya.[13] During the British Colonial period, the city served as the capital of Jaipur
        State. After independence in 1947, Jaipur was made the capital of the newly formed state of Rajasthan.
       
        Jaipur is a popular tourist destination in India and forms a part of the west Golden Triangle tourist
        circuit along with Delhi and Agra (240 km, 149 mi).[14] It also serves as a gateway to other tourist
        destinations in Rajasthan such as Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, Bharatpur, Udaipur, Kota and Mount Abu.
       

        On 6 July 2019, UNESCO World Heritage Committee inscribed Jaipur the "Pink City of India" among its World
        Heritage Sites.[15] The city is also home to the UNESCO World Heritage Sites Amer Fort and Jantar Mantar.
